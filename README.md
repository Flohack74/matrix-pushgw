# matrix-pushgw
A custom Push Gateway for Matrix.

This code was forked from https://github.com/slp/matrix-pushgw and will be used to develop a push gateway for Ubuntu Touch. Therefore, expect this repo to be only an intermediate place to hack. Final integration will be done on https://github.com/ubports/ubuntu-push
